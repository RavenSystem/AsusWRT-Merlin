# RavenSystem's AsusWRT-Merlin configuration

This is the configuration from my AsusWRT routers, with AsusWRT-Merlin firmware installed.

I have tested different Asus router models, and I have experience developing some AsusWRT-merlin Addons. My setup manages more than 70+ network connected devices (60+ wifi devices).

Under [Config](Config) you will find all config options and screenshots.
